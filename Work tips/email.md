# Outlook
This is how I set up my Outlook and some work tips. 
### Favorites
I like to use Favorites to help me respond to the important mail.

### Rules  
Settings > Mail > Rules  

- Categorize important email
  - reports
  - C-suite ...

Creation is self-explanatory:

### Categories

Star adds category to Favorites in the main email view.

### OOO time, PTO approvals etc. 
I do share a whole day event with the teams I work with. They know when I am away.

The same way I ask my reports to share all day event with me, indicating PTO, SD etc.  
I can mark my self as  `Free` after accepting `Out of office` event.
